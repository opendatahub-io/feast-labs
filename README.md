# feast-labs

This repository hosts multiple domain-specific labs demonstrating the end-to-end process of leveraging a Feast Feature Store. Each lab covers raw data ingestion, feature serving for model inference, and culminates in a prototype Streamlit application for demonstration.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into distinct directories, one for each domain-specific lab, ensuring modularity and ease of navigation.
